# Unilab project

This project was created by me following design provided by Unilab. It is as close as I could make it. You can go to second page by clickin Learn more and return to first page by clicking HOME, also third page is available by clicking DISCOVERY and returning on first page is possible by simply once again clicking HOME button. Also by reducing screen size to mobile, you can view menu bar which is also possible to use for navigation.
